# USACO Editorials

This is the list of editorials that I have contributed to [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) so far. Here are [my contributions](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/commits?author=tachithanhdanh) and [the pull requests](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atachithanhdanh+user%3Acpinitiative) that I have contributed to [USACO Guide Github Repository](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/)).

The **most active** pull request that I have ever created was **[this pull request](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/pull/658)**. Overall, the pull request received numerous responses from many reviewers and team members, most of which were aimed to enhance the quality of the solutions that I wrote, especially [this editotiral](https://usaco.guide/solutions/usaco-712?lang=cpp). Moreover, due to a huge number of suggestions and contributions from the reviewers, it took roughly **8 days** to finally merge the pull request into `cpinitiative:master` from `tachithanhdanh:master`, which is a long period in my opinion. There were **41 commits** and nearly **110 comments** were made in the discussion of perfecting the `solutions/editorials`.
