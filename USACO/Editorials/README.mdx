# USACO Editorials

This is the list of editorials that I have contributed to [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) so far. Here are [my contribution statistics](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/commits?author=tachithanhdanh) and [the pull requests](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atachithanhdanh+user%3Acpinitiative) that I have contributed to [USACO Guide Github Repository](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/)).

The **most active** pull request that I have ever created was **[this pull request](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/pull/658)**. Overall, the pull request received **numerous responses** from many reviewers and team members, most of which were aimed to enhance the quality of the solutions that I wrote, especially [this editorial](https://usaco.guide/solutions/usaco-712?lang=cpp). Moreover, due to a huge number of suggestions and contributions from the reviewers, it took roughly **8 days** to finally merge the pull request into `cpinitiative:master` from `tachithanhdanh:master`, which is a long period in my opinion. There were **41 commits** and nearly **110 comments** were made in the discussion of perfecting a total of `6 solutions/editorials` from `2 modules`. 

For your information, the statistics are shown below:
- Number of pull requests created: **16**
	- Merged: **13**
	- Closed: **3**
	- Opening: **0**
- Number of solutions written by me: **16** (All of them are in `CPP`)
- Most **detailed** editorials (in my opinion) in each division:
	- General: [Promotion Counting](https://usaco.guide/solutions/usaco-591?lang=cpp)
	- Bronze: [Why Did the Cow Cross the Road II](https://usaco.guide/solutions/usaco-712?lang=cpp)
	- Silver: [CSES - Traffic Lights](https://usaco.guide/solutions/cses-1163?lang=cpp)
	- Gold: [Fruit Feast](https://usaco.guide/solutions/usaco-574?lang=cpp) (Since there is **only one** solution written by me, so definitely this is the best editorial :D)
